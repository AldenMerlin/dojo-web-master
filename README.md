Coding Dojo - code and  programming training local

## Overview
**Coding Dojo** is a safe environment for testing new ideas, promoting networking and sharing ideas among team members. It is very common for companies to promote open Dojos. In this way the company can meet professionals who can adapt to its environment and professionals also have the opportunity to know the environment of these companies.

### Formats
**Kata:** In this format there is the figure of the presenter. He must demonstrate a ready-made solution, previously developed.
The objective is that all participants are able to reproduce the solution achieving the same result, being allowed to make interruptions to resolve doubts at any time;

**Randori:** In this format, everyone participates. A problem is proposed to be solved and the programming is carried out on only one machine, in pairs. For this format, the use of TDD and baby steps is essential.<br/>
The person coding is the pilot, and his partner is the co-pilot. Every five minutes the pilot returns to the audience and the co-pilot assumes the status of pilot. A person from the audience takes on the position of co-pilot.<br/>
Interruptions are only allowed when all tests are green. It is also important to note that it is the pair who decide what will be done to solve the problem. Everyone must understand the solution, which must be explained by the pilot and the co-pilot at the end of their implementation cycle;

**Kake:** It is a format similar to Randori, however there are several pairs working simultaneously. Each shift the pairs are exchanged, promoting integration between all participants of the event. In this format, more advanced knowledge of the participants is necessary.
